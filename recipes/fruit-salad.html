        <h3>Description :</h3>
        <p>Fruit is essentially nature’s candy, but unlike refined sugar products, it is actually good for you! I also love that Mother Nature offers us different bounties throughout the seasons, meaning our fruit salads – and the nutrients associated with different seasonal produce – can change during the year.</p>
        <p>This tropical fruit salad happens to be my favorite combination of fruits for the whole year. So this summer, do your best to make use of all the sweet, seasonal fruits like mangoes, jackfruit, chikoo and berries.</p>
